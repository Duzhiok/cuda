Deadline : 2 weeks ( 18th 6 pm)
Upload your program to D2L.




Q1) Write a CUDA program using single thread block and multiple thread blocks to 
    do reduction (sum) on an array.

 
OR
 Write a CUDA program using single thread block and multiple thread blocks to 
    do prefix sum of an array. 
   

 To implement parallel reduction/prefix sum, you can use the CREW algorithms from Chapter 2 slides.
    


Use comet.sdsc.edu cluster for running the CUDA program.
    

1.  Use putty if you are using windows OS to connect.
    The server name is comet.sdsc.edu 
    Enter account name that you provided me after creating an account on XSEDE.
    Enter password.
    
// for me it is spuri2@comet.sdsc.edu
    
  


2.  Compile : module load cuda  (to make nvcc work)
  
nvcc -o prog your_cuda_program.cu   (use the extension as "cu") 




3.  Use cudascript.sb (attached) to submit the job. This script assumes that "prog" is
 the name of your executable.

    Submitting job to the COMET cluster :
 sbatch cudascript.sb    
    

¡£/
4.  To check the status of your job: 
squeue -u your_username to check the status of your job.
